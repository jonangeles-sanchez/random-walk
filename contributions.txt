Johnny:
- Lightgrey grid (last bullet point on assignment)
- Clear and submit button (4th bullet on assignment)

After Completion:
I successfully completed the Clear and Submit button. I had a little help from
Jonathan Sanches Angeles with javascript because he understands it more. We made a Function
called clearSubmitFunction() and told the button to go to the clearSubmitFunction() whenever
the (clear and submit) button is pressed. The function clears the value, adds
a new one, and submit the new value. I attempted to work on making the grid
lightgrey but Leonardo Bernardes finised it and submited it on github before I
got to it.


Michael:
- add a no limit option to the walk length drop down list and have that preselected (first bullet point on the assignment)


Leo:
- By default have the grid size drop down preselected to 25
- Made all the dots in the grid lightgrey
- Helped implement the no limit option to the walklength

Jonathan:
- "add in color" (5th bullet point)
- "random seed text input sticky" (3rd bullet point)
