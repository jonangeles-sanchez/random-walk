Johnny:
- Lightgrey grid (last bullet point on assignment)
- Clear and submit button (4th bullet on assignment)

After Completion:
I successfully completed the Clear and Submit button. I had a little help from
Jon with javascript because he understands it more. We made a Function
called clearSubmitFunction() and told the button to go to the clearSubmitFunction() whenever
the (clear and submit) button is pressed. The function clears the value, adds
a new one, and submit the new value. I attempted to work on making the grid
lightgrey but Leonardo Bernardes finised it and submited it on github before I
got to it.


Michael:


Leo:
- By default have the grid size drop down preselected to 25
- Made all the dots in the grid lightgrey
- Helped implement the no limit option to the walklength

Jonathan:
- "add in color randomization" (5th bullet point) - did not finish
- "random seed text input sticky" (3rd bullet point)
- Oversaw work contributions and verified functionality of all functions. I was able to help each contributing member with their
contributions. I also managed the GitHub to recieve and update any changes that occured. I helped Johnny with his clear and submit button and functionality
by helping him integrate javascript. Leo and I worked on no limit option and created functionality. I completed the stickiness of value options and did not
finish the color randomization.
